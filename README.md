# Reshape and integrate large scale data sources for highly efficient genome analysis

An example for running the iGD:
  1. Download iGD_b14.ipynb to your local computer
  2. Download roadmap from data/ and mkdir (roadmap_igd)
  3. Open a terminal (linux) and cd to the folder 
  4. Type: jupyter notebook iGD_b14.ipynb
  5. Change the ifilePath to the roadmap folder and ofilePath the folder roadmap_igd in the last cell
  6. Run all cells--an igd database roadmap_b14.igd and roadmap_index.tsv will be created in the roadmap_igd folder
