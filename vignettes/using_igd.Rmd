This vignette shows how to create an iGD database from roadmap dataset and then search the iGD database for overlaps with a query file.

## Create roadmap iGD database

First download the entire rme folder of the [roadmap data source](http://big.databio.org/igd/data) to the current working directory. The rme contains 1905 `.bed.gz` data files;
Then:  
```
igd create "rme/*" "rme_igd/" "roadmap"
```

This will generate
1. a folder `data0` and subfolders `chr1,..., chr22, chrX, chrY` with ~180,000 igd bin files (mode 0); 
2. a folder `rme_igd` with a single igd database file (mode 1) `roadmap.igd` and dataset index file `roadmap_index.tsv`.


## Search iGD for overlaps

Download a sample query file--[query100.bed] (http://big.databio.org/igd/data) to the same directory as above.
 
Then:
```
igd search query100.bed rme_igd/roadmap.igd
```
