This vignette shows benchmarks of iGD for searching igd database `roadmap.igd` and `ucsc.igd` with `igd search`.

## Benchmarks for roadmap.igd

Database roadmap.igd  is created from Roadmap data source by using iGD, see vignettes `using_igd.Rmd` for detailed info. It can also be downloaded from [databio.org/igd](http://big.databio.org/igd). Unzip it after download(`~1.3GB` with a folder `rme_igd`).

A series [query files](http://big.databio.org/igd/queries) of various number of region sets are used for testing:

```
for i in 10 100 1000 10000 100000 1000000
do
time igd search queries/r$i.bed rme_igd/roadmap.igd 
done
```
The following results are from a laptop of 2.5GHz cpu:
0.009s, 0.009s, 0.014s, 0.051s, 0.338s, 2.085s. 


## Benchmarks for ucsc.igd

Database ucsc.igd is created from ucsc data source and it can be downloaded from [databio.org/igd](http://big.databio.org/igd). The compressed file `ucsc.igd.tgz` is 22GB and unzipped database file ucsc.igd is about ~123GB in a folder `ucsc_igd`. 

Using the same query series for testing:

```
for i in 10 100 1000 10000 100000 1000000
do
time igd search queries/r$i.bed ucsc_igd/ucsc.igd
done
```
The following results are from a laptop of 2.5GHz cpu:
0.206s, 1.671s, 16.239s, 144.222s, 13m26.413s, 17m6.142s.
